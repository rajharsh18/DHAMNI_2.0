<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Blood bank shortage is a very big issue in India. According to some reports, India needs 15 million units of blood each year but manages to collect only 11 million units, a deficit of 4 million units. It is also estimated that nearly 12,000 individuals die in India each day, due to non-availability of quality blood. While this is only one aspect of the problem, the other aspect indicates that India wastes about 6.5 lakh units of blood and blood components each year, due to lack of proper storage facilities.</p>
<p>So, with the aim to fill the gap between the blood donors and blood banks we came up with the idea of “Dhamni”. Dhamni is a website which will work as an intermediate between blood donors and blood banks. Those individuals who are willing to donate blood can give their information and can retrieve the information of the blood banks near them to make it easier for him to donate blood.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dhamni in English means Arteries, a critical part of your cardiovascular system. They are blood vessels that distribute oxygen-rich blood to your entire body. 
In India, many people die due to the lack of blood banks or shortage of blood in the blood banks. This problem become more severe during covid-19 pandemic. Many patients who required blood lost their lives dur to this enormous problem.</p>
We figured out that there is a big gap between blood donors and blood banks in India. Most of the people are even not aware about the importance of blood donation. So, we decided to fill that gap by giving a platform to the people where they will be aware about the importance of blood donation. A place where they can easily reach out to blood banks and a needy patient can also contact the blood banks for help.
<h2>Current and Future Scopes</h2>
The main objective behind “Dhamni” is to increase the awareness of blood donation in people and make it easier for them to donate blood.<br>
This website can further be used to analyze the blood demand, blood types, diseases and many more things using the data collected.
